## The Focus definition file

Lives in `src/main/resources/data/attuned/attuned/focus/<name>.json`.

| Field       | Type    | Required | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|----------|---------|
| `item`      | text    | yes      | The item id, always `attuned:<name>`. |
| `cost`      | number  | no (1)   | Attunement points the Focus uses. Usually 2–6. |
| `unique`    | boolean | no (false) | If true, only one copy of this Focus can be active at once; a duplicate stays dormant. |
| `affinity`  | text    | no       | `fury`, `bastion`, or `zephyr`. Omit for a neutral Focus. |
| `modifiers` | list    | no ([])  | Stat changes — see [Attribute modifiers](#attribute-modifiers). |
| `behavior`  | text    | no       | A registered behavior id, e.g. `attuned:stormcall`. |

A Focus with no `affinity`, no `modifiers`, and no `behavior` is legal — it just
does nothing. Most Foci use either `modifiers` or `behavior` (or both).

## Affinities

Three affinities form a rock-paper-scissors cycle:

```
Fury  beats  Bastion  beats  Zephyr  beats  Fury
```

- A Focus with an `affinity` pulls its wearer toward that lane. When every
  active affinity-bearing Focus shares one affinity, the wearer is **committed**
  to it — counter-combat and the Apex capstone apply.
- Running active Foci of **two or more** affinities is **Discord**: every Focus
  still works, but the wearer is a glass cannon — dealing and taking extra
  damage — and cannot reach Apex.
- A Focus with **no** `affinity` is *neutral* — it never triggers Discord and
  fits any committed lane.
- Pick an affinity for combat-flavoured Foci; leave it off for utility Foci.

## Attribute modifiers

Each entry in the `modifiers` list is three fields:

```json
{ "attribute": "minecraft:armor", "amount": 2, "operation": "add_value" }
```

The framework applies these when the Focus becomes active and removes them when
it stops — you never write cleanup code.

### Operations

| Operation              | What `amount` does |
|------------------------|--------------------|
| `add_value`            | Adds a flat amount. `2` on armor = +2 armor. |
| `add_multiplied_base`  | Adds `amount` × the stat's **base** value. `0.15` = +15% of the base. |
| `add_multiplied_total` | Multiplies the **final** total by `1 + amount`. `0.15` = +15% after everything else. |

Use `add_value` for flat bonuses, `add_multiplied_base` for a clean percentage
of the unmodified stat (this is what most percentage Foci want).

### Common attributes

| Attribute                          | Controls | Note |
|------------------------------------|----------|------|
| `minecraft:max_health`             | Maximum health | `2` = one heart |
| `minecraft:armor`                  | Armor points | |
| `minecraft:armor_toughness`        | Armor toughness | |
| `minecraft:knockback_resistance`   | Knockback resistance | `0`–`1`, where `1` is immune |
| `minecraft:movement_speed`         | Walking speed | percentage works best |
| `minecraft:attack_damage`          | Melee damage | |
| `minecraft:attack_speed`           | Attack cooldown speed | |
| `minecraft:jump_strength`          | Jump height | percentage works best |
| `minecraft:safe_fall_distance`     | Blocks you can fall unhurt | |
| `minecraft:fall_damage_multiplier` | Fall-damage scale | `-1` cancels all fall damage |
| `minecraft:block_break_speed`      | Mining speed | |
| `minecraft:step_height`            | Auto-step height | |
| `minecraft:luck`                   | Loot luck | |
| `minecraft:scale`                  | Body size | |
| `minecraft:water_movement_efficiency` | Movement speed underwater | |
| `minecraft:oxygen_bonus`           | Underwater breath | |

Any vanilla player attribute works — these are just the common ones.

## Behaviors

A behavior is a Java class for a Focus power that a stat cannot express. It
implements `FocusBehavior`, which has three hooks — all run on the server, and
all are optional:

| Hook            | When it runs |
|-----------------|--------------|
| `onActivate`    | Once, when the Focus becomes active. |
| `onTick`        | Every server tick (20×/second) while active. |
| `onDeactivate`  | Once, when the Focus stops being active. Undo things here. |

"Active" means equipped **and** within the attunement budget. A Focus pushed
over budget goes dormant and counts as deactivated.

Behaviors are registered in `AttunedContent.init()` and referenced by the
`behavior` field. The ones that ship with Attuned, smallest first — good
examples to copy from:

| `behavior` id        | Source file              | What it does |
|----------------------|--------------------------|--------------|
| `attuned:delver`     | `DelverBehavior`         | Refreshes a Haste effect. |
| `attuned:nightgaze`  | `NightgazeBehavior`      | Refreshes Night Vision. |
| `attuned:emberward`  | `EmberwardBehavior`      | Fire immunity. |
| `attuned:tide`       | `TideBehavior`           | Underwater breathing. |
| `attuned:bloodfury`  | `BloodfuryBehavior`      | Attack speed scaled by missing health. |
| `attuned:harvest`    | `HarvestBehavior`        | Speeds up nearby crops. |
| `attuned:aegis`      | `AegisBehavior`          | Periodic absorption shield (uses a cooldown). |
| `attuned:lodestone`  | `LodestoneBehavior`      | Pulls nearby dropped items in. |
| `attuned:beacon`     | `BeaconBehavior`         | Points a held compass at your bed. |
| `attuned:stormcall`  | `StormcallBehavior`      | Lightning while sprinting in rain. |

### When a power is not a behavior

A few effects are too special for the tick-based behavior hooks and live in
their own classes — read these if your idea resembles them:

- **Death effects** — `combat/GravebindSave.java` hooks the death event.
- **Teleports / inputs** — `network/AttunedNetworking.java` and the client-side
  `client/VoidstepInput.java` handle Voidstep's double-tap and blink.
- **Affinity combat** — `combat/AttunedCombat.java` handles damage between
  affinities (Thornward, Leech).

## Numbers you can tune

Server-side settings live in `config/attuned.json`, written on first launch.
Every key is optional and falls back to a built-in default:

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `starting_capacity` | 4 | Attunement capacity a new player begins with. |
| `capacity_cap` | 20 | Highest capacity an Attunement Shard can reach. |
| `capacity_per_shard` | 2 | Capacity each Attunement Shard grants. |
| `focus_loot_chance` | 0.25 | Chance a targeted structure chest yields a Focus. |
| `voidstep_cooldown_ticks` | 200 | Cooldown of the Voidstep blink, in ticks. |
| `gravebind_cooldown_ticks` | 1200 | Cooldown of the Gravebind death-save, in ticks. |

A couple of values are still set in code:

| Number | Where |
|--------|-------|
| A Focus's cost | the `cost` field in its `data/.../focus/<name>.json` |
| Number of Focus slots (6) | `SIZE` in `attunement/AttunedInv.java` — the inventory UI assumes 6, so changing this is involved |

The `/attuned capacity` command reads or sets a player's capacity for testing.

## Where everything lives
